[Card Error](./screenshots/cardFormError.png)
[Stripe Backend Dashboard](./screenshots/allPayments.png)

## What you learned

- learned about Stripe's integration on running payments
- explored the different aspects of Stripe's API and creating a PaymentIntent
- how to create Stripe customer object and store credit card details
- used Stripes UI element library 

## What Didn't Work
- features like subscription, integrating wallet pay, email notice, and other features required bank account connection and more advanced setup of the Stripe account (moving it from test to live or setting up a merchant account)
- other features like form fill were blocked, requiring an HTTPS connection

## Authors

- just used stripe
